# Overview
This is a typing practice game made in Python with pygame. The player can choose between three game modes: speed where the player types for a set amount of time, accuracy where the player types until they make a mistake, and 'Fun Run' where the player runs from a skeleton by typing correctly.

# Implemented Features
1. Menu 
    - A standard menu that let's you get to different options in the program.
2. Game modes 
    - All game modes have different rule sets in which progress of speed and accuracy is calculated at the end.
    - Speed gamemode - This gamemode has the player follow the word set they chose also within the time that they chose.  
    - Accuracy gamemode -  This gamemode has the player follow the word set they chose with no time limit.
    - Fun Run gamemode -  This gamemode has the player type the word set they chose, but adds a "minigame". You control a sprite on the screen, if you misstype a letter he goes backwards towards an enemy and if you type correctly the players sprite runs farther away.
3. Change topic by changing word sets
    - The player has the ability to pick different word sets for the typing game. Each word set contains words that are related to different topics.
4. Timing options
    - This is specifically for the first game mode. The player is able to select how long they want to play the game mode for
5. Statistics
