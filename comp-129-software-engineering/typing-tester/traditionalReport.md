## Project Objectives
---
<br>
<p>
The scope of this project involves creating three game modes with different wordsets and timing options which will return the 
statistics of the player upon completing the game.
<ol>
<li>Game Mode 1<br>
This game mode will allow the player to type out the wordset within a time limit. At the end, the user will have the statistics on his performance.</li>
<li>Game Mode 2<br>
This game mode will allow the player to type out the wordset with no time limit and will run as long as the user correctly types out the wordset. At the end, the user will have the statistics on his performance.</li>
<li>Game Mode 3<br>
This game mode is similar to Game mode 2 yet, it introduces animations within the game in the form of zombie and a person. As long as the player types correctly in a row, the player won't be eaten by a zombie and lose the game. At the end, the user will have the statistics on his performance. 
</li>
</ol>

## Project Design

Our Team's goal is to deliver the game that meets all the criteria of the user stories under a good timeframe.

## Implementation Details
### Language
Python 3.10.10
### Libraries and tools
- `pygame` for the framework to build our game on
- `pipenv` to keep our development environment and dependencies synchronized
- `pytest` to create unit tests for our game
- `matplotlib`, `pandas` & `seaborn` to create visuals from statistics
- `pyinstaller` to create the final deliverable executive
#### Challenges and solutions
- One big challenge we had in the beginning was organization. We had quite a few Git conflicts with branching and similar issues. In order to fix this, we decided it would be best to make sure that whenever we work on something, we use a branch to avoid conflicts. This ended up working a lot better for the team and merging our code together.
- Another challenge was learning what we needed to know. We used a lot of new libraries and techniques in order to make sure our code was great but it took us a while to be confident with everything. The solution for this was simple, just getting more experience with everything and a lot of communication to teammates. Some of us knew certain parts of libraries while others knew seperate parts so communicating that was helpful.

## Project Highlights
- We are very proud of the wordsets as well as the statistics. Of course we are proud of everything we put into the software but the two that stuck out the most are the wordset (specifically the letters turning red or green as you type them) and the statistics (specifically the calculations and graphs as these were much more complex then the rest).
- Coming up with the stories and dividing them up. When we met we usually agreed on everything and did a good job. Towards the end working in branches and following the style we planned worked well too.
- The main problem we ended up solving was just our communication. This applied to both communicating about problems we have and when we could meet as well as communicating about code we were working on and merging problems. We worked on our communication by doing simple things like making a google sheets that has when we are all available in order to plan better. With our code communication, we started working in branches so that we wouldn't have any conflicts when merging.

## Things To Be Improved 
- A part of the software that felt lackluster and that we would want to improve is the overall interface. Even though this is a game, you can't really back out of (like when you click on a specific button that brings you to another page) or even pause parts of it (like when you are playing one of the gamemodes). In addition to the interface, it didn't really look too appealing or have anything special to it. 
- Some parts of our teamwork that could be improved was communication. We had a few problems communicating things we needed or times we were available. This also resulted in the additional problem of finding perfect meeting times for everyone.

## Lessons Learned
<ul>
<li>Make sure to research carefully on different libraries and tools that you will use for your project. Understand fundamentally how each works.</li>
<li>Keep an eye out on any types of branching or git conflicts</li>
<li>Communicate with your teammates, make sure you are all on the same page</li>
<li>Reach out to your teammates for help, they might know something</lid>
<li>Don't always rely on your teammates, thy are busy. Try to learn from tutorials online</li>
<li>Define times you can actually work, then make a commitment to meet</lid>
</ul>
