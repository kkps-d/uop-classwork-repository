# Testing and Strategies
For our testing strategies, we originally just decided to individually test it in our own ways as we didn't know as much about testing. Towards our second or third sprint, in order to keep our code better tested and organized, we decided to go with unit tests for the more important features. In addition to unit tests, we found integration tests very helpful with organization and testing.

## Test Cases
### [Word set test](https://github.com/comp129/customer-project-entei2023/blob/main/test_word_set.py)
Our first test was for the word set as it was a bit troublesome to start with and get perfectly on the screen,

### [Single game statistics test](https://github.com/comp129/customer-project-entei2023/blob/main/test_single_game_statistics_file_io.py)
Another unit test we made was for the statistics calculations. This is obviously an important test since we need to return the players statistics accurately and originally, we had a problem with one of the calculations that it helped us find.

### Timer test
One more unit test we decided to implement was for our timer class. It made sure our clock was running fine and there wasn't any other problems with it.
